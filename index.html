    <p>
      Hi, my name is Ryan Pacheco and Iâ€™m a data and machine learning engineer in the Boise, ID area. I have a Masters
      of Science in Computer Science where I tested and deployed the universities natural language processing research
      tools to pypi to make the system more readily available. Professionally I have worked on the software engineering
      side of machine learning, taking models that Data Scientists train and fine tune and getting them ready for
      production along with building any infrastructure that is needed to support the models. I am passionate about
      getting to make new exciting products that help move a buisness forward and elevates the team. I love working with
      talanted individuals who want to colaborate to make the most exciting and high functioning code around!

        <ul>
          <li>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</li>
          <li>While working at Cadent I worked closely with the data science team to research how a natural language
            processing model could be used in our workflow. I also worked to unit test custom apache airflow operators
            while migrating custom jobs to airflow.</li>

          <li>Data Engineer</li>
          <li>Durning my time at Micron I worked as a data engineer migrating native PySpark scripts running on local
            Hadoop to Google Clould Platform. I also worke dto create a utility tool to interface with data stored in
            Google Big Query or Cloud Storage.</li>

          <li>Software Development Intern</li>
          <li>At Kount I worked to design, implement, and maintain the companys model governance system used to move
            machine learning models from research to production. This system was an set of microservices that interfaced
            with a postgres database that kept track of all model information and meta data needed for pre and post
            processing. In addition I worked closly with data scientists to implement machine learning models into
            existing code bases. I did this by often translating python reasearch code into production ready Go code.

      I have primarily worked as a data and machine learning engineer focusing more on the software engineering side of
      machine learning. I am passionate about getting to work on new solutions to existing problems and building tools
      that assist and elevate the research of data scientists, as well as bringing the models that data scientists
      create to a production ready state that is valuable to the business.
